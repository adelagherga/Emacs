These files generate all elliptic curves of conductor 500000-500999 by solving
a large list of corresponding Thue and Thue--Mahler forms. To run this program
using GNU parallel, running at most 20 jobs in parallel, run

cd LMFDB
computeEllipticCurves.sh

This program proceeds as follows:
1. Solve all relevant Thue equations and output elliptic curves, in parallel.
   At most 20 jobs are run in parallel, and GNU parallel's progress is
   recorded in the logfile Data/ThueTest1Log.
   a. Each line, "set", of Data/Forms/ThueTestForms.csv is taken as input
      to the magma program Code/computeEllipticCurvesThue.m. This magma
      program solves the Thue equations listed in set, outputs a logfile in
      Data/ThueLogfiles, and if there are relevant elliptic curves, outputs
#	these in Data/ThueOutfiles.
#	Note that multiple lines of Data/Forms/ThueTestForms.csv may correspond
#	to the same conductor, and thus elliptic curves of the same conductor
#	may be spread across multiple such outfiles.
# 2. Solve all relevant Thue--Mahler equations and output elliptic curves, in
#    parallel. At most 20 jobs are run in parallel, and GNU parallel's progress
#    is recorded in the logfile Data/TMTest1Log.
#    a. Each line, "set", of Data/Forms/TMTestForms.csv is taken as input
#       to the magma program Code/computeEllipticCurvesTM.m. This magma
#	program solves the Thue--Mahler equations listed in set, outputs a
#	logfile in Data/TMLogfiles, and if there are relevant elliptic curves,
#	outputs these in Data/TMOutfiles.
#	Note that multiple lines of Data/Forms/TMTestForms.csv may correspond
#	to the same conductor, and thus elliptic curves of the same conductor
#	may be spread across multiple such outfiles.
# 3. For each conductor N in the range 500000-500999, generate a file
#    Data/EllipticCurves/N.csv.
# 4. Iterate through all files in Data/TMOutfiles and, for each file containing
#    elliptic curves of conductor N, append the output of these files to
#    Data/EllipticCurves/N.csv. Repeat with Data/ThueOutfiles.
