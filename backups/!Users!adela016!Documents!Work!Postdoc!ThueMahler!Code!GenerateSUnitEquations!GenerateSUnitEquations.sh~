    # Output:
    #
    # Example:

    line0="$1"
    # remove white space between characters
    # ie. write [ p_1, p_2, ..., p_n ] as [p_1,p_2,...,p_n]
    # this step is necessary as Magma input does not allow for empty spaces
    line="$(echo -e "${line0}" | tr -d '[:space:]')"

    lineB="${line/\*/}" # remove * sign
    lineC="${lineB/\*]/}" # remove *] characers

    # compute the conductor (ie. first number)
    N=$(echo $lineC | grep -o -E '[0-9]+' | head -1 | sed -e 's/^0\+//')
    # compute the coefficients of the TM form
    clist="$(echo $lineC | cut -d"," -f2-)"

    echo $N
    echo $clist
}

 cat /Users/adela016/Desktop/SortedForms_for_Cond_10to6\ copy.txt | parallel InputTMForm


 should run as magma N:=$N C:=$clist
