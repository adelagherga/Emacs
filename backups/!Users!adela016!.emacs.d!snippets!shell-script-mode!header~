# INPUT:
#    N/A
#
# OUTPUT:
#     S_i.out:= the file containing the set of all solutions X + Y = Z^2 with good redeuction outside the set of primes S_i, where
#        S_i:= [2,p_1,...,p_{n_i}], as listed in the file nSets.out
#
# COMMENTS:
#    This algorithm is a bash function. It runs through all sets S.out where S:= [ p_1, p_2, ..., p_n ] as printed in nSets.out and output by SUnitXYZ2.m
#    This alrogithm sorts through the files S.out and amalgamates all corresponding solutions into one file, S=[p_1,...,p_n]
#    If errors exist in any of the files, an error is printed, along with the filename S.out
#    To run in the background, enter the following in a terminal window:
#        $ nohup $ABSOLUTE_PATH/ThesisCode/XYZ2Code/BashXYZ2Code/RunSUnitXYZ2.sh $ABSOLUTE_PATH &
#
# EXAMPLE:
#    N/A
