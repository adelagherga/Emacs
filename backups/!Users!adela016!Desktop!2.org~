** Read about procrastination
*** About emotions, not laziness
*** Allows escape from stress, anxiety and provides instant reward/gratification
*** Creates more stress, anxiety, and therefore a loop
*** Cannot exit loop until provide bigger, better reward
*** One option: forgive self when procrastinate
*** Procrastinators tend to have high stress and low self-compassion
**** Self-compassion: commitment to meeting your challenges with greater acceptance and kindness rather than rumination and regret. Try to reframe the task by considering a positive aspect of it, ie. positive outcome, praise from boss, etc.
*** Other ways to manage procrastination triggers:
**** When feeling urge to procrastinate, focus on the thought and ask why, what is source, etc
**** Focus on next action instead of breaking up task into bite-sized chunks
**** Make temptations more inconvenient, and tasks at hand more convenient (ie. block social media apps, leave gym clothes handy, resp.)

*** Try self-dialogue: ie. ask self why not do task at hand, what does doing task make me feel that makes me want to not do it, etc.
*** Leisure activities at a time when leisure is not supposed to happen: full of guild, self-hatred, anxiety and dread, leading to bizare purgatory of weird activities like refreshing email, fantasizing about completing a job, scrolling facie, etc.
*** Only time this goes away is when the Panic Monster arrives (deadline or other scary consequence thing)
**** But sometimes the Panic Monster doesn't show up at all or only does so for the things we have to do, not want to do, leaving us feel unfullfilled
*** It doesn't make sense to stop work to procrastinate; both suck to do, but procrastination only leads to misery, whereas doing the work actually leads to happiness
*** If can work for some time, making progress on a task leads further away from procrastination; if can work until reach the tipping point where all desire goes to finishing the work task
*** I need to prove/show to myself that I can do it, not just tell myself that I need to stop procrastinating
    1. Try to internalize that everything is a choice
    2. Create methods to avoid procrastination (set a reminder a month from now to see if things have improved; if not, change the aforementioned methods)
    3. Aim for slow, steady progress, both in work completion and in stopping chronic procrastination (goal isn't to be perfect, but to improve)
       a. ie. aim to go from "I procrastinate on every hard task" to "Once a week, I do a hard task without procrastinating"
*** Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent and Important, Urgent but not important, etc)
    | -------         | *Urgent*    | *Not Urgent*         |
    | *Important*     | 1.  do now  | 2. decide when to do |
    | *Not Important* | 3. delegate | 4. discard           |
    |                 |             |                      |
*** Quadrant 1 and 3 are visited, but most time is spent in Q4. To thrive, grow, and blossom, need to spend time in Q2 also
*** Q1 often doesn't exist: "What's important is seldom urgent, and what's urgent is seldom importnat"
*** Like most PhD students, I'm spending my time in Q4, occasionally in Q3 (learning C at the start of the day instead of focusing on TM code)
*** When I'm *busy*, I'm usually just in Q3
*** Undergrad and highschool, I was probably in Q1, Q3, Q4; had a solution-ish to procrastinating (scary deadlines), but it wasn't healthy or sustainable (often too stressed or too busy to do anything else)
*** Need to shake off delusion and have a clearly defined "important" and "urgent", which delves into the question of what matters most to me
*** Important: contributes to our long term goals, values
*** Urgent: should revolve around self-discussion about what's most self-important; ie what would benefit most from happening sooner or later
*** Need to be conscious of the monkey; remind self with "Yup, there's the monkey, right on que"

1. *Need to forgive self*. Accept that I have been procrastinating, recognize that there is nothing I can do about the past, and forgive myself for it. Nnot feel guilty about procrastinating up until this point. Start fresh with a clean slate and pretend that I was only now just assigned the work. Let go. Be free.
2. *To start*. Pick a small thing to do; make it super easy, always think about Next Action and plan small reward for it. Use the 3 second rule or non-negotiable timeslot
3. *Become a slave*. Pretend you have no choice in the matter. No free will. Will get the crap beaten out of me if I don't work. (ie. like group marking, or in a lecture theatre teaching)
4. Find something enjoyable in the task.


** reply to Gene
** reply to women+non-binary in math group

** Meeting with Rafael - January 25, 2021
*** leave Thue solver stuff for now
*** find out why Thue stuff is slow: explain why it's slow (see if they come from complex case; use our TM solver if possible)
*** find bottleneck of TM code
