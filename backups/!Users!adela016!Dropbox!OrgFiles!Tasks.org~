** TODO File TM Code info


**** currently gathering jobs which are not printed in any of TMForms, NoSUnitEqNeeded, NoSUnitEqPossible
- this is the only places these output pieces should have gone
**** (TODO) run GenerateSUnitEq on IncompleteForms
**** (TODO) clean up files
**** (TODO) Start daily work log using org - backup in dropbox

**** Next Steps
   - gather all TMform data and seperate by clist,optimal clist
     + see if they have same optimal clist, and if not, ensure they do
   - generate new Thue forms while also generating TMforms to have alist, primelist printed (ie.
     remainingCase)
   - issue: cases such as
     + 891869,"(2,1,2,2)","(1,6,5,2)","(1,6,5,2)","[ 3 ]"
     + 891958,"(2,1,2,2)","(2,-20,-9,-1)","(1,-20,-18,-4)","[ 3 ]"
     + 892136,"(2,1,2,2)","(7,-10,7,-2)","(1,-10,49,-98)","[ 3 ]"
   - all have the same original clist, but opted for different GL2Zaction; *should consolidate*
   - generate individual files based on original form; consolidate afterwards
     - retrieve from TMforms via ie. grep "[0-9],\"(1,15,-93,-207)\"" TMFormData.csv

   - idea: generate seperate documents of TMforms for each clist and consolidate there
     + [do this after ensuring all jobs are finished]



   - re-align headers (verify all code in TMForms/Code to date
   - iterate through TMForms.m to generate proper Thue equations
   - iterate through NoSUnitEqNeeded.m to generate proper Thue quations
