  - *call Air Canada*
  - *to-do list for the UK*

  - back up data (emacs setup on git, org files on dropbox (may need to reset dropbox))
  - external monitor and stand (UK)
  - extra fridge (?)
  - go through Emacs from scratch
  - order Romanian book
  - move plants
  - fridge this weekend
  - consolidate to-dos
  - Shoppers trip
    - toothpaste, floss, mascara, eyeliner, small blending brush, lashes, prescription, masks,
    - visors
  - C programming book
  - packing + storage
  - insurance

* TM Code
  - currently gathering jobs which are not printed in any of TMForms, NoSUnitEqNeeded,
    NoSUnitEqPossible
    - this is the only places these output pieces should have gone

** Next Steps
   - gather all TMform data and seperate by clist,optimal clist
     + see if they have same optimal clist, and if not, ensure they do
   - generate new Thue forms while also generating TMforms to have alist, primelist printed (ie.
     remainingCase)
   - issue: cases such as
     + 891869,"(2,1,2,2)","(1,6,5,2)","(1,6,5,2)","[ 3 ]"
     + 891958,"(2,1,2,2)","(2,-20,-9,-1)","(1,-20,-18,-4)","[ 3 ]"
     + 892136,"(2,1,2,2)","(7,-10,7,-2)","(1,-10,49,-98)","[ 3 ]"
   - all have the same original clist, but opted for different GL2Zaction; *should consolidate*
   - generate individual files based on original form; consolidate afterwards
     - retrieve from TMforms via ie. grep "[0-9],\"(1,15,-93,-207)\"" TMFormData.csv

   - idea: generate seperate documents of TMforms for each clist and consolidate there
     + [do this after ensuring all jobs are finished]



   - re-align headers (verify all code in TMForms/Code to date
   - iterate through TMForms.m to generate proper Thue equations
   - iterate through NoSUnitEqNeeded.m to generate proper Thue quations
