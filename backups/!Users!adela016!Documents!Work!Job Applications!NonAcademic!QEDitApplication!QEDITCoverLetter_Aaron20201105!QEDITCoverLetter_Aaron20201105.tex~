\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

%
I am writing to you because I am interested in becoming your next Cryptography
Engineer Intern. \old{I have a Ph.D. in mathematics, earned in May 2020, with my
  dissertation} \new{In May 2020 I received my Ph.D.\ in Mathematics with my
  dissertation} on \old{generating} \edit{(designing? creating?)} and
implementing algorithms to compute elliptic curves using lattice-based reduction
techniques. \new{Presently, I hold a postdoctoral fellowship in algebraic number
  theory at the University of Warwick, and am seeking industry experience in
  complement of my research posting.} I have over 10 years of experience \old{in
  mathematics research in collaborative environments} \new{doing research
  mathematics in collaborative environments}, merging algebraic number theory
with programming. I have the academic background, programming experience, and
enthusiasm for cryptography that I believe QEDIT is looking for.

\old{As a computational and algebraic number theorist, my Ph.D. and research}
\new{My doctoral} work \new{in computational and algebraic number theory}
focused on computing elliptic curves over the rational integers via solutions of
certain equations called Thue-Mahler forms. To solve these equations, my
collaborators and I developed new mathematical techniques and \old{refined}
\new{created/designed} algorithms, which I implemented as software packages in
\new{the} programming languages \old{called} Magma and SageMath. This work
involved solving nearly $10^8$ Thue-Mahler forms and subsequently storing and
\old{appropriately} categorizing \edit{(categorizing reads like an
  administrative task. Do you mean this, or do you mean a technical task? If
  latter: characterizing? analyzing?)} their solutions. To speed up this process
\edit{(Reads like it's for your own convenience, rather than a literal necessity
  for having been able to complete the work. Consider re-phrasing.)}, I taught
myself how to code in Unix bash to \old{setup} \edit{(setup is a noun; set up a
  verb)} \new{write/design/create} a parallel-computing algorithm, as well as
how to work with large data structures \edit{(There's no such thing as a large
  data structure, to my knowledge. Do you mean one for working with large data?
  If so, perhaps suggest which kind. I'd get useful information out of knowing
  if it was e.g. \texttt{dask} dataframes for distributed and OOM computing or
  e.g. Bloom filters or bucketed hash tables)} to parse the results using
Python. This experience not only prepared me with the necessary academic
background to work as a Cryptography Engineer Intern \edit{(Is that why you did
  all this? To be a CEI? ;-)}, but it also developed my proficiency in learning
new coding languages and gave me valuable experience collaboratively developing
and maintaining code through GitHub \new{The computational challenges of this
  work have cultivated my proficiency in\ldots My experience as a research
  mathematician gives Adela whatever analytical tools she thinks she needs for
  this post}.

My strong communication skills are \old{attributed to my} \new{enabled by} many
years of teaching and community outreach experience. As a Ph.D.\ student, I held
the role of course instructor for several undergraduate calculus courses, as
well as Teaching Assistant for many other undergraduate courses. In particular,
I was Teaching Assistant to 6 undergraduate number theory courses, wherein I
implemented affine and RSA encryption algorithms for students to download and
experiment with during the Cryptography portion of the course \edit{(As stated,
  this highlights only higher level pedagogical ability, but should also
  highlight the communication expertise required to effectively curate learning
  resources for undergrads)}. \old{Alongside} \new{In partnership with} the
instructor, I \old{helped write and develop} \new{wrote and developed} an
open-source elementary number theory textbook\new{,} which is still in use by
the mathematics department \old{today}. In addition to teaching, \old{for 3
  years} I \new{was a member of the TA Training team for three years,}
\new{during which I facilitated the development and on-boarding of incoming
  graduate students} \old{helped train incoming graduate and undergraduate
  students in their roles as Teaching Assistants}. Outside of the university, I
have spent 4 years volunteering with Future Science Leaders, an after-school
program for high-school students interested in science and mathematics. I helped
organize and facilitate lectures on mathematics, and developed and delivered a
\old{course} \new{module} introducing cryptography through affine and shift
ciphers. This experience has not only improved my general communication skills,
but also my ability to break down complex mathematical topics into simple terms
understandable to a non-expert.

\old{Though I currently hold a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Warwick University,}
\edit{(its name is University of Warwick)} I am eager \old{for an opportunity}
to gain industry experience\old{, especially} in a setting \old{which}
\new{that} combines cryptography, mathematics, and programming. The majority of
my experience with cryptography has been to demonstrate how certain encryption
algorithms work and why\new{.}\old{, but I have rarely had} \new{I am excited
  by} the opportunity to \old{use} \new{develop} algorithms in \old{real-life}
\new{practical} settings, and \old{I am excited} \new{all the more} by the
prospect of doing so in \old{and} \new{an} industry setting at QEDIT.\@ Of
course, I also know what Q.E.D. means \edit{but would appreciate learning the
  meaning of its neighbouring two letter suffix I.T.}. \qed


Thank you for your consideration.
